<h1>RELIGIOUS AND CHRISTIANITY</h1>

<p1>
In Trevor Noah Born a Crime, he recounts his childhood in South Africa under the apartheid government and the first few years of democratic rule by the nationâ€™s black majority. Born in 1984 to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss expatriate father, Noah is not merely an anomaly in apartheid South Africa; his existence is actually illegal because the regime outlawed relationships between people of different races,and that is why trevor noah says that he was  born a crime.In chapter one trevor tells  us how the south africans were treated by the colonial goverment. But in this book trevor noah mum brings out a theme of courage and dares to have a child with a swiss white man by the name robert.The black people had also adopted the religion of colonizers and trevor noah mum was so religious and she loved going to church</p1>

<p2>.The colonial goverment had built churches within southafrica, their were three types of churches but trevor and her mum used to go to these all churches because they wanted to gain more in biblical studies.The first church was mixed church that was rhema bible church. it was one of those supermodern,megachurches.Ray Mega was pastor to mixed church then the second church was Rosebank union in sandton this church belonged to wealthty white people who lived at johhannesberg.Then their was black chucrch a church that we are told it never ended, the service lasted as from morning to evening unlike rosebank church where people used to get out early after services.Black people especially the grandmothers loved attending the black church.And we are told that those grannies were in blue and white blouses.But all in all patricia's family would attend both services</p2>
